                I am a doctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/">Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)</a>, University of Mannheim. In my research, I employ (quasi-)experimental methods to address questions regarding intergroup relations, focusing on minority experiences. I am also interested in the role of AI in social science research.

                <h3><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t9w5p_v1" target="_blank">Childhood Exposure to Ethnic Outgroups Predicts Interethnic Marriage</a></h3>
                <p class="abstract">Scholars posit that childhood exposure to ethnic outgroups may durably improve intergroup relations. However, few studies to date track the consequences of childhood experiences across multiple decades. Moreover, existing research focuses on majority populations and largely overlooks the impact of exposure for minorities. Using linked geocoded US census records from 1880 to 1900/1910, we examine childhood outgroup exposure and subsequent marriage patterns for over 400,000 American, German and Irish men. To account for residential self-selection, we use machine-learning to identify "ethnic" neighborhoods and compare individuals living within the same residential contexts but having different next-door neighbors. In majority-minority dyads, outgroup exposure is consistently associated with a higher likelihood of marrying a member of that group, as well as a lower likelihood of ingroup marriage. The evidence is less robust for minority-minority dyads but nonetheless supports an overall pattern wherein childhood experiences can serve to erode ethnic group boundaries.</p>

                <p class="abstract">Generative artificial intelligence is transforming the way scholars draft, revise, and publish. Yet, academia lacks a systematic way to measure these shifts and risks relying on anecdotal evidence in evaluating whether AI elevates or erodes scholarly standards. This Comment draws on a pre-registered, three-day field experiment that addressed this lack of measurement by pairing twenty-two early-career researchers with and without AI tools to improve scholarly manuscripts for journal submission. However, the AI models used in the field experiment are already outdated and outperformed by more powerful reasoning models, situating the results as a snapshot in time. This Comment calls for recurring events with a similar set of evaluation criteria to combine the results in a publicly available dataset. Monitoring the quality of researcher-AI collaboration is necessary if academia wants to keep track of AI's rapid impact on research practice.</p>
