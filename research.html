                <p><em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em> 12, 1707 (2025). <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-06110-1" target="_blank">doi:10.1057/s41599-025-06110-1</a></p>
                <p>Building upon a field experiment with early-career social scientists, this paper proposes institutionally establishing AI-Sprints and an AI-researcher collaboration benchmark. It outlines design principles for authentic research tasks, comparable evaluation criteria, and long-term data archiving to track human-AI collaboration evolution in academic writing.</p>

                <p>M. Ratkovic; T. Gschwend; K. Bauer; A. Kurella; O. Rittmann; M. Sauter; N. Schwitter; Leonard Wendering</p>
                <p>This randomized controlled trial evaluated GPT-4o's impact on expert academic writing through a three-day hackathon with early-career social scientists in collaboration with Springer Nature. The field experiment randomized access to AI tools and found that AI assistance produced significant improvements in clarity and coherence without affecting originality, methodological rigor, or literature relevance.</p>

                <p><span class="badge badge-progress">In progress</span></p>
                <p>Leonard Wendering*; N. Zhang; K. Ostermann</p>
                <p>This study examines how childhood intergroup contact shapes long-term behavioral outcomes using linked full-count US Census data from 1880 to 1900 and 1910. Tracking more than 400,000 boys from childhood to adulthood, the research tests whether having a next-door neighbor of a different ethnicity increases interethnic marriage rates later in life. The study employs a machine learning algorithm to define organic neighborhoods, coarsened exact matching for causal identification, and analyzes three ethnic groups (American, Irish, German) during the peak immigration period of late 19th-century America.</p>

                <p>Leonard Wendering*</p>
                <p>This study systematically tests the relevance of cooperation in interethnic intergroup contact in a field experimental setting. Conducted at a German vocational school with 195 students, I randomized the seating arrangements in classrooms and group compositions in workshops over a three-week period. The study compares prejudice reduction effects between less cooperative classroom settings (front-to-back teaching) and more cooperative workshop settings (collaborative group work).</p>
