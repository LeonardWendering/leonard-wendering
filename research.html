                <h3>"The Girl Next Door? Childhood Cross-Group Exposure Increases Rates of Inter-Ethnic Marriage"</h3>
                <p><em>In progress</em> (with N. Zhang, K. Ostermann)</p>
                <p>This study examines how childhood intergroup contact shapes long-term behavioral outcomes using linked full-count US Census data from 1880  to 1900 and 1910. Tracking more than 400,000 boys from childhood to adulthood, the research tests whether having a next-door neighbor of a different ethnicity increases interethnic marriage rates later in life. The study employs a machine learning algorithm to define organic neighborhoods, coarsened exact matching for causal identification, and analyzes three ethnic groups (American, Irish, German) during the peak immigration period of late 19th-century America. Results demonstrate that childhood exposure to ethnic outgroup neighbors significantly increases the probability of interethnic marriage.</p>

                <h3>"Reducing Prejudice through Intergroup Contact: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Vocational Schools"</h3>
                <p><em>In progress</em></p>
                <p>This study systematically tests the relevance of cooperation in interethnic intergroup contact. Conducted at a German vocational school with 195 students, I randomized the seating arrangements in classrooms and group compositions in workshops over a three-week period. The study compares prejudice reduction effects between less cooperative classroom settings (front-to-back teaching) and more cooperative workshop settings (collaborative group work).</p>

                <h3>"Lessons from an AI-Sprint: Evidence from a Field Experiment with Early-Career Researchers in the Social Sciences"</h3>
                <p><em>In progress</em> (with M. Ratkovic, T. Gschwend, K. Bauer, A. Kurella, O. Rittman, M. Sauter, N. Schwitter)</p>
                <p>This randomized controlled trial evaluated GPT-4o's impact on expert academic writing through a three-day hackathon with early-career social scientists in collaboration with Springer Nature. The field experiment randomized access to AI tools and found that AI assistance produced significant improvements in clarity and coherence without affecting originality, methodological rigor, or literature relevance.</p>

                <h3>"Lessons from an AI-Sprint: A Proposal for Measuring the Human-AI Evolution in Research"</h3>
                <p><em>In progress</em> (with M. Ratkovic, T. Gschwend)</p>
                <p>This comment proposes establishing a network of institutional AI-Sprints to continuously benchmark how artificial intelligence influences academic work. The piece advocates for data-driven policies on AI use in scholarship through recurring field experiments across disciplines. The proposal outlines design principles for authentic research tasks, comparable evaluation criteria, and long-term data archiving to track the evolution of human-AI collaboration in academic writing.</p>
